are 25 in number. Supposing them to be at their full complement,
to contain 6100 foot soldiers‚ with a cavalry force of 776 attached
to them, the total amount would be in round numbers, 170‚000
men. Besides these there were auxiliary troops stationed in the
provinces, about equal in strength to the legionaries (neque-multo
secus ἱη iis uirimn); so that the forces of the Roman empire
would be about 340,000 men.9
