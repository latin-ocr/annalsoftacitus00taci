xxii TACITHS, ANNALS IV

Tacitus, a chanipion of the Senate, writing of the early
part of the reign of Tiberius (iii 60), tells us how the Emperor,
while strengthening the powers of the Principate, yielded to the
Senate the seniblance of its ancient authority, by referring to
its discussion petitions from tho Provinces.

A fine sight it was (writes Tacitus>—ma9na eius diez· speeies
fuitffltfo sec the Senate inquiring into these matters, free as
in olden days to cancel ιη· confirm. But Tacitus knows that
this power is a mere phantom. There was no joint govern-
ment. It difi'ered in no respect fron] monarchy‚—7wn alia re
Romana quam 3ῑῖ nunus imperitet (iv 33).

There remained (according to Stobartl) another motive
f‹›1·adrnitting the Senate to partnership, a [notive so simple
and practical that it almost eludes the notice of the constitn—
tional historian. Until a new machinery could be created,
until a competent civil service could he organised, the mere
burdcn 0fad111inistrati0n was inore than one man could bear.
...... By degrees a civil service is organised. Then, as there
is less need of the Senate, its impm'tance steadily decreases.
This is the explanation of the paradox that the more Augustus
seems to retire from public offices, the more business is
absorberi into the imperial chancellery.

In iv 22, 34, 42, and other passages we find Tiberius pre-
siding at the senatorial high court of justice. The power of
pardon has passed entirely to the Emperor. It is proposed
in the Senate (iv 30) that Serenus should be scourged to death
more vyzczz'ormn. The Emperor exercises his power of inter-
06332'02 ,· and Serenus is banished.
