INTRODUCTJON xxi

(written 49 B.C.)‚ where Cacsar is said to wish for nothing
better than principe Pom poio sine oleta uiuere..

Pelham infers from these and similar passages that tl1e
notion of a First Citizen at the head of affairs, of a princeps
or princeps ciuitatis, was already familiar to the Roman
public, when Augustus set to work to re-organise the stato.
Pelham adds that by imperial writers the terni principatus
is carefully distinguished from dominatio, regymwn, and dicta-
tura as a constitutional authority. Compare Ama. i 9 non
reyno tamen ‘neque dictatura sed prz'nczjn’s mmzz'nc constitutam
rem publicam.

The Emperor was imperator, consul, etc. But to describe
his relation to the whole citizen body—as merely the first of
themselves—no term was so suitable as princeps

VI. THE SENATE UNDER THE EARLY EMPIRE

⁷ Boissier1 is justly surprised at modern historians, who,
(i) because Tiberius one day remarked that the Emperor
must be the servant of the Senate, and (ii) because Nero
invited the Senate to resume its ancient functions, imagine
that they really restored them. They have, he says even
invented a new word—‘dyamhy²—to designate this joint
government 2. “

2 Compare Stobart, ‘The Senate under Augustus‚' Classical
Quat-term, vol. ii, p. 298 :-—‘If we choose our term according to
the spirit, then undoubtedly Monarchy is the only appropriate
definition. Not only had the Princeps gathered into his hand all
the functions of the* executive‚ but the deliberative was defucto
subordinate to him. When the deliberative organ becomes an
atlvisory council selected by one man, and when the electing body
merely registers the choice of that single person, then it is Mon-
archy, however temperately conducted. In every sense Dyarchy
is an unsatisfactory term.’
