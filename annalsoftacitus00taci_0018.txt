found that the style he had created was effective and popular,

Tacitus is above all things an artist. Racine, quoted by
Boissier (p. 68), calls him the greatest. painter of antiquity ;
and ‘some of the pictures he has left are among the finest
surviving to us from ancient writers. ...... Professional men
charge him with defective information as to topography,
number of combatants, distribution of troops, phases of the
struggle. But let some novel or curious episode intervene3
and at once the narrative is again brisk, interesting, and full
of coloui' (130188181, p. 69).

Similarly Livy is fond of‘ pleasant little resting —placesss as
he says in ix. 17, ut.. ,Ζιφεγείίὸιιὸ uelut deuerticula amoena et
requiem (zozimo meo ‹lucrer-erem. Tacitus' love of variety of
expression is very remarkable. Note how in iv 5 (a mere
catalogue of provinces and legions) Tacitus constantly varies
the form of expression. His frequent variety of syntax is
well illustrated by iv :38:fflquod aliz· modestam, multi quia
diffideret, quidam vt (leyenerz's animi inteipretabantmu His
vocabulary is largely made up of poetica] words ; and there
are many echocs of Virgilian expression z see these examples
from Book IV:
