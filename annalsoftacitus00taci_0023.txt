INTRODUCTION xix

He arranged the long-standing difficulty of the throne of
Armenia, and converted the client-kingdoms of Cappadocia
and Commagene into Roman provinces. Then came a great
tragedy. Germanicus died at Antioch, the victini, it was
said, of foul play on the part of his riml Piso, governor of
Syria. He stands out as a charniing popular heio—‘one of
the short-lived loves of the Roman people.’ The death of his
son Drusus in 23 ΑΛ). was a very grievous blow to Tiberius.
Nothing was left but to adopt the two eldest sons of German-
icus, Nero and Drusus. But his widow Agrippina was not
satisfied even with this proceeding, which marked out these
two princes as snccessors of Tiberius.

It is interesting to observe what vigorous Ianguage Tacitus
habitually employs in writing of the family of Germanicus:
e.g. iv 12 domum Germanici reuirescere occulti laetabantur:
and in the same chapter, pudicitia A‘qrz'ppz‘nae inpenetrabile]
and again, ut superbam fecunditate, submlram popularibus
studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arquereut. Com—
pare also iv 15. referring to Nero, recenti memoria Germanici
illum aspici, illum audiri ‘remmam-‚¹ also iv 17, 18, 19; and
52 Ayrippz'na semper atrox. Compare 53 peruicax irae, and
the rest of the chapter.

The turning-point in the history comes when Sejanus
proposes to marry the younger Livia (Livilla). Foiled in
this by Tiberius, he makes up his mind to destroy the house
of Germanicus.
