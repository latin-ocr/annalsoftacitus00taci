15. seposuit Aug-ustus. This verb is often used by Tacitus
of a mild type of exile. Merivale writes (c. 45) : ‘The treatment
of exiles seems generally to have been sufficiently mild. They
were allowed to a great extent the choice of locality3 and when
Augustus forbade them to settle at any spot within 50 miles of
the continent, he excepted the pleasant retreats of Cos, Rhodes,
and Lesbos. He also confined them to a single ship of 1000
amphorae and two pinnaces for the voyage and conveyance of
their famssies, which further were limited to 20 slaves or freedmen.'

16. specie studiorum. Marseilles was a noted home of Greek
culture. Agricola studied there. Cf. Strabo iv 1, 5 (writing of
Augustus) ἐν δὲ τῴ παρόντι καὶ τοὺς ’γνωριμωτάτους Ῥωμαίων πέπεικεν
