unde dubitare...uacuum. Merivale (Romans under the Εἰιιρίνε,
c. 45) has some useful comments on this passage z—‘Tacitus‚ as
a disciple of the school of the fatalists, is constrained on this
occasion to enquire whether the favour or hostility of princes is a
matter of mere chance and destiny, or whether there may not
still be room for prudent counsel and good sense in the conduct
of human affairs; whether a secure path of life, however hard to
trace, might not still be discovered amidst the perils of the times,
between the extremes of rude independence and base servility.
The great defect of the Romans of this period lay in their want of
the true sels-respect which is engendered by the eonsciousness of
sober consistency. Bred in the speculative maxims of Greek and
Roman republicanism, they passed their manhood either in un-
learniug the lessons of the schools, or in exaggerating them in a
spirit of senseless defiance.‘
