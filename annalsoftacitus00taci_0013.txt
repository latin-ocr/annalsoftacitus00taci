sat‘mn. For literary history it is important 10 notice that
in his preparation for this book he was training himself as a
historian.

In 100 A. D. Tacitus (along with the younger Pliny) prose-
cuted 1n a famous case, -111-11 of Malius Priscus¹ gover·n‹›1 of
Afflssa, who was com 1cted of extortion and violence. Pliny
speaks of the dignity of Tacitus' eloquence.

Under Vespasian and Titus the position of Tacitus was
easy. During Domitian’s reign of terror it was much more
difficult. He speaks of ‘fifteen years—a large slice carved
out of human life—during which in silence and inaction
young men reached old age, and old men their full term of

words he puts in the mouth of Marcellus (Hist. iv 8) 1—se
meminisse quemn ciuitatis formam patres auique instituerint ;
ulteriora mirari, praesentia sequi ,· bonos imperatores uoto
expetere, qualescumque tolerare ; i.e. he is an opportunist.

11 appears from an inscription found in Caria that towards
the end of Trajan’s reign Tacitus was proconsul of Asia,
113-116 (about)—one of the most important posts in the
Empire. There is no evidence as to the time of his death.
Since he did not write the life of Augustus, or the history of
