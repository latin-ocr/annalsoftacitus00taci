17. exuere, se understood. exuo is a favourite metaphor
with Tacitus, Cf. c. 21. ffl,pakfflimslb
satis aestima-re. ‘This is not the same thing as satis eristi-
mare3 at least, I can find no undoubted instance of the use of
aestimare in the sense of ⁶ thinking.' Tacitus always, I think,
uses the word in the sense os ‘valuing,' ‘rating‚' ‘appraising⁷....
The sense here therefore is that Sejanus valued at its full worth
the security obtained for his family by the proposed arrangement.
He gave the proper value to it, and, so to say, did not want more
for his money’ [P.F.]. He refers to these and other passages:
Ayric. 40 maynas uiros per ambitionem aestimare; Germ. 6 in
uniuersum aestimante] xii 42 an grauius aestimandmn?
19. multum superque, the only instance of this expression.

several times in slightly varying phrase: onmia sunt inte-qra—'z‘n
integro res nobis est—mihi integrum estfacere aut nonfacere. Cf. ad
