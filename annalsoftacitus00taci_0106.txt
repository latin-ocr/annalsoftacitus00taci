Warde Fowler illustr-ates this by a ‘ most extraordinary story '
from Livy (xxvii 8). In 209 B.c. C. Valerius Flaccus. the black
sheep of a great family, was inaugurated against his will as
Flamen Dialis by the Pontifex Maximus, P. Licinius. Livy
expressly tells us that it was ob adulescentiam ueyleyemcm
Zumuriosamquffi and it is pretty plain that the step was sug-
gested by the relations to keep him out of mischief. For
the disabilities on this ancient priesthood were, as we have seen,
numerous and strict3 and among the restrictions laid on its
holder was one which forbade him to leave his house for a single
night (p. 342). The strange thing in the case of Flaccus is that
this office had such a wholesome disciplinary effect that the
libertine became a model youth, the admiration of his own and
other families (p. 343). See however note on line 13 (below).
