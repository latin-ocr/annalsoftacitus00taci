xviii TACITUS, ANNALS IV

IV. GERMANICUS AND HIS FAMILY

For an adequate nnderstanding of Book 1v of the Amzals
it is necessary to know something of Germanicus and his
family.

The early days of the reign of Tiberius were disturbed by
mutinies in the armies of the Rhine and Danube. On the
Rhine there was a furtherdanger, viz. the wonderful influence of
Germanicus with his soldiers, who had given him that familiar
title, his only name in history. Germanicus Caesar, governor
of Gaul and commander of the eight legions on the German
frontier, was marked out as the successor of Tiberius⁷ his
uncle and adoptive father ; and ‘the troops of Lower German y
conceived the design of hastening his 1·eign¹.' But Germanicus
himself had no ambitious hopes of empire. Accordingly he
took the oath of allegiance to Tiberius, and distracted his
troops from thoughts of mutiny by a famous series of German
campaigns, 14-16 A.D.

The third and last campaign of Germanicus was planned
on a great scale. He placed his troops on board a fleet of
1000 vessels and sailed through the Fossa Drusiana <the
canal of his father Drusus), and the Zuyder Zee to the Ocean,
landing his forces at the mouth of the Ems. The Ger-mans
could no longer resist effectually3 and Germanicus only
wanted another year for the complete subjugation of the
whole country from the Rhine to the Elbe. But the Emperor,
maintaining the policy of Augustus that the Roman rule
could not be extended to that river, recalled Germanicus to
Rome. In May, 17 A.D.‚ he celebrated a splendid triumph
over the conquered Germans.

He was then sent to the East with a far-reaching com-
mand including all the provinces beyond the Hellespont.
