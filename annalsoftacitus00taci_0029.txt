INTRODUCTION xxv

Suetonius: ‘It is the part of a good shepherd to shear his
sheep, not to flay thenis

The following chapters in Book iv are also important for
the history of provincial management,—-23—:262 43, 44, 46-51,
72—74.

This passage from Tiberius the Ἰῖιρ-ανιῐ (p. 380) is useful :—
‘Tiberius treated the Senate with formal respect, and did his
best to make it worthy of its opportunities. If he could
have avoided interfering with its administration of its own
provinces, he would have done so. Tiberius, like Augustum
supplied himself with an inner Council of the senate ; and it
is possible that on most occasions the inner Council repre-
sented the whole body. But he did not restrict himself to
Senatorial counsellors ; and we are told that, in dealing with
provincial questions, he was always careful to provide himself
with the expert evidence of men who knew the localities
concerned. The Senate was euriously indifferent to muni-
cipal matters. The rank of senator eventually became little
more than an honour-able distinction. The difference between
Senatorial and Imperial Provinces did not last long, the
Imperial administration proving better suited to the needs of
the Empire.'

VIII MAIESTAS

Mazestccs populi Romani and maiestatem mznuere or laedere
aQthuan-BQQ Cicero (de

inuentione ii 53) gives this definition. ·—maiestatem oni-nume
est de diqnecate aut amplitudine aut potestate populi aut
eorum, quibus populus potestatem dedit, aliquid deroyare.
Compare Verres ii 88 crimen ricaiestatz's, ‘charge of treason‚'
and pro Cluentio 97 legionem sollicitare res est quae 2698
maiestatis tenetur. The scope of maiestas was · ·' n d

bg a law of Julius Caesar. It Q by Augustus ;
but he made little use of it.
