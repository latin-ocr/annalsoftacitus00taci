xxiv TACITUS‚ ANNALS IV

See note 011 iv 5, 15. Colchis, Iberia, and Albania formed a
belt from the Euxine to the Caspian, and were protected
(says Tacitus proudly) ‘by our name.'

Four legions held ‘the vast sweep of country' from the
borders of Syria to the Euphrates.

Egypt was held by two legions stationed at Alexandria.

Mauretania had been handed over to King J uba ; the rest
of Africa was held by two legions.

In Spain there were three legions. See note on iv 5, 7.

This list makes up a total of twenty-five legions for the

cohorts and ten cohorts of Praetorian guards.

Tacitus adds: ‘At suitable points in the provinces the
allied fleets were stationed, and the auxiliary horse and foot,
representing a total strength not much inferior to that of
our own forces' See last explanatory note on iv 5.

In iv 13 come words which strike the key—note of
Tiberius’ provincial government,——p7·eces sociorum tractabat.

were convicted during his reign, eg. Granius Marcellus pro-
consul of Asia, and C. Silanus proconsul of the same province 3
Caesius Cordus procurator of Crete, and Vibius Serenus
procurator of Further Spain. For other prosecutions see
iv 13 and 15. The Emperor's general policy towards the
provinces is given in the words put into his mouth by
