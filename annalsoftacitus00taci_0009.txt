PREFACE

HE Fourth Book of the Annals is an excellent
introduction to Silver Age Latin and to the
history of the early Principate3 and altogebher it
is a most stimulabing subject, as I found from
reading in with Dr Butler in the Sixth Form ab
Harrow in 1874. Little did I then think that
inore than ‘forty years on' I should receive from
the Syndics of the Press a request} to edit this
book in their Series. There are many books of
various kinds to help bhe editor of Tacitus in his
work. Ι am especially indebted to Nipperdey,

Halm, Furneaux, Boissier, and Ramsay.
