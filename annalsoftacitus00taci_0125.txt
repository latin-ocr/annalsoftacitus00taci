Ramsay has some useful remarks on this chapterz——‘ Tacitus
does not appeal here to a high conception of history. He takes
the popular view that it reaches its highest interest in telling of
wars and conquests. Even the interest of such subjects as the
conflict between the Orders, and the battles over Agrarian 'and

constitutional questions, but that they give scope for picturesque
and stirring narrative. His own task is inglorious, because he
has no wars to tell of; and the climax in its dulness is that
Tiberius was what we should now call a Little Englander.'

power in a state.
