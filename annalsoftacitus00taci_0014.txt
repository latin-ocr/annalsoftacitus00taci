Nerva and Trajan, as he intended, he probably did not
survive the completion of the Aomals. Thefflmnieagss

title of the work 111 the Medicean MS. is Cornelvi Taciti ab
excessu dmi Aayusti. Tacitus calls it annales, because it is

arranged according to y ears. It consisted originally of 16 01·

XI, ΧΠ. Books I—VI would have coveied the reign of

Tiberius. VII would have begun that of Gaius (37 A.D.).
XI begins with the sixth year of Claudius <47 A.D.). XII
carries us to the end of Claudius (54 A.D.). XIII—end would
have given us the whole of Nem. XVI, as we have it, ceases
at 68 ΑΛ). Evidently the anibition of Tacitus was to cover
the whole period from the beginning of Augustus to the end
of Trajan.

 

 

 

II. TACITUS As A LITERARY ARTIST

‘All of them profess great affection for letters; it is onc
way of justifying and ennobling their fortune. Not only have
they studied eloquence in their youth; to speak well is an
indispensable accomplishment for a Roman magistrate3 but
they take an interest 111 philosophy or even compose elegies
and epiCS. 1 do not believe that in any other period has
literature been so greatly loved. Seneca even considers that
it is loved too much, and that people carry their taste for it
to the point of mania: litterarum intemperantia laboramus
(Epist. cvi 2). lt was, in short, a very agreeable society,
which no longer had the distinction and high bearing of the
early days of the Empire, but in which were still to be found,
with a less spacious life and simpler manners, much charm
and wit!
